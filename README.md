- who are you?
- where are compile instructions? directory layout instructions?
- where is the code?
- You can't use anything copyrighted, so using "Harry Potter" is illegal.

# Henry comments 27/April
- I haven't seen any updates here
- This file still needs compile instructions, and directory explanation so I know where to find stuff.
- Your changelog needs a lot of work
- Where is your project code?
- Your data hasn't progressed enough. You need to get to this very quickly, as you can't start building your game until you can at least load the levels/world of your game. So work on getting loading working (from data files) asap.
